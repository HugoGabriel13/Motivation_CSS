Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:



3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.

4. The text should be center aligned.

5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div.
